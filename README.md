# password-manager
Welcome to Password Manager!
This was one of my assignments while doing an online course on Python. I did have to use a couple of hints from the resources, but other than that, I did it myself.
After that I added the option to save/load default email address and a button to clear all entry fields. 
It's a simple program, it let's you save your passwords to a json file, so it's not made for security, but convenience ;)
The password generator was another assignment from earlier, it's been integrated into the manager, it's a really good generator, the number of letters, symbols and
numbers is also random, so it will create a password that should prove very difficult to hack.
I will try to add more features as I learn new skills with Python.
Thanks!
